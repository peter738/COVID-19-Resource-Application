# COVID-19-Resource-Application

## **Project Description**


This project is meant to automate the retrieval of COVID-19 statistics, policies, and best practices. Statistics will be limited to the greater Philadelphia area. Users will have access to a desktop application that will allow them to view current statistics including: Current Case Count, Positive Case Rate, Testing Count, Testing Rate, Death Toll, etc.. User’s will also have access to practical information such as: What to Do if a Household Member has COVID, Best Practices to Limit Chance of Infection, etc.. On execution of the application a new window will be opened with the applications UI, providing a drop down menu with options of what information to view. All information will be refreshed and updated when the program is executed, pulling from a set of information resources. I will be building this application using the Netbeans IDE, the Jsoup web automation library for Java, and the Javax Swift framework to build the GUI.



## This project will demonstrate the application of several of the course’s educational goals:

1. Object Oriented Programming - I will be using the OOP language Java to build this app, utilizing inheritance in order to communicate between my two main libraries, encapsulation to maintain organization of information, polymorphism, and abstraction.
2. Graphic User Interface - to make this app usable to the client I’ll be building the graphic user interface through java Swing, incorporating buttons, drop menus, and different navigation tools.
3. Unified Modeling Language - to better show the structure and use of the application I’ll be creating UMLs.
4. Test Driven Development  - throughout the project I will be building JUnit tests because this will be my first time using some of these libraries and thorough testing will be necessary to ensure operations function as desired
5.Debugging - Netbeans debugging tools will be used alongside the JUnit tests for more targeting problem solving
